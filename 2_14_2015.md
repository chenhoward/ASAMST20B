## Black Korea. Ice Cube (1991)
So don't follow me, up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
of the nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the black fist
or we'll burn your store, right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya!
Cause you can't turn the ghetto - into Black Korea

## Cop acquittals (4/29/92), days of rage
Media depictions: merging of 2 issues (police brutality, groccer-customer relations.)
White oppression through police
Middleman Korean merchants.  Question: Are Korean merchants themselves oppressed?
Common colonized histories.
