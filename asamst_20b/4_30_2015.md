## Korean Americans in post-65
- No longer invisible
- Race relations could not be ignored
- 2 directions
- - Align with civil rights agenda
- - Align with conservative whites.

## Is race relations important?
- Differing Asian American student responses

## Racial Triangulation
- Racial valorizations.  Superior to inferior scale.  Asians as "honorary whites".  Justification of black inequality.
- Civic Ostracism.  insider to foreigner scale.  Justification for racial inequality of non-black minorities.  AA as the "other"

## Racial Valorization
- Steroetypes control mechanism.  White supremacy oppresses AA's through stereotypes.  Adopted by AA's.  Conformity - accpetance.  Divergence-racial hatred.

## MM is used to indirectly criticize
- Post-racial language
- Race relations seldom discussed
- Model minority indirect criticism of blacks without provoking black-white tension
- MMM, temporary shield for Asian Ams.

## Civic Ostracism - disloyal Asians
- Resistance -racial valorization

- Need to counter "honorary white" status
- Promote historical instances of multi-racial solidarity.

- Resistance-civic ostracism

## What happens if there is no AA Voice?
- Edward Blum's voice predominates
- Manipulation occured in history
- Model minority myth used to attack other minorities- Divide & rule
- Leave AAs vulnerable to civic ostracism & racism
