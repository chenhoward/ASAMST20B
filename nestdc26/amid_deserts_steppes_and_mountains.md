# Amid Deserts Steppes and Mountains
## A Bowl of Sand in a Rocky Cradle
- Most of it is flat and low.
- Full of sandy desert
- Bordered by green plains in the North with no trees.
- South and East are bordered by mountain ranges.
- Very arid despite having two inland seas.
- Snows all around during the winter.
- The deserts have extreme temperatures, dust storms, and erode land used for farming.
- The Pamir range reachs about 7,500 meters.
- Water is abundant in some mountains and plateaus.
- Rivers end at Aral Sea.
- Capsian Sea is shared with many other countries, moderately saline.

## Extreme Environments
- Winters in north Kazakhstan can go lower than -20 degrees celcius.  It averages over 30 Celsius southern Turkmenistan.
- Mountain slopes get much colder with elevation.
- Doesn't rain in deserts, gets much rain in the mountains and steppes.

## Deserts: Land That Makes Demands
- Central Asia has 40% of it covered with desert.
- Huge amount of biodiversity in the desert.  Plants and animals adapted to live in extreme
conditions.
- Black and white saxual are the most common tree shrub vegetation in these deserts.
- Long dry summers.
- Has two seasons, and precipitation can fall any time of year.
- Droughts often reduce harvest
- Dust storms last from 20-40 days, lowering yields.
- Desert mist appears between 10 and 20 days a year, creating danger for transportation.
- Muruntau gold mine in Uzbekistan is one of the largest open pit mines.

## Steppes

### Taming a Boundless Expanse
- Results from low and unstable preciptation
- Various types of steppes
  - Low mountain desert
  - Mid-altitude
  - Mountain Xerophtye
  - Mountain Grassland
  - Semidesert
  - Shrub and Brushwood
  - Forest
- Kazakh steppe is the dryest in the region
  - Dry summers
  - Cold winters with little snow
  - Large Rivers
  - Grassland, fescues and wild oats

### The Steppes and Human Influence
- Used by nomadic herders
- Due to heavy cereal cultivation steppe deterioration occurred
- Overgrazing affects these rangelands.
- Industrial use contaminates the soil, water, and vegetation

### Protecting the Steppes
- Use of salt-tolerant Plants
- Improve feed and livestock production tech
- Crop rotation
- Better management of the water

## Piedmont
Foothills at the base of mountains ranges
- 350-1500 meters elevation.
- Good for cattle pastures.
- Has pistachio woodlands.
- Famous fertile valley, the Fergana Valley, is heavilu populated

## Mountains

### Towers of Diversity
- Covers approximately 10 percent of the land
- Altitude compresses climates, huge biodiversity

## A Trove of Resources
- 50% of all humans depend on mountain resources
- Provides fresh water to Rivers
- Contains primary forest resources to area
- Tien Shan has pastoralist and provides oil, gas, hydropower, antimony, copper, gold, lead and tungsten

## Agriculture to Uranium: Natural Resource Powerhouse
- Global climate change threatens the ecology of Central Asia
- Oil and Gas gets pumped out of central Asia
- Biofuel is being investigated
- Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have abundant uranium reserves
