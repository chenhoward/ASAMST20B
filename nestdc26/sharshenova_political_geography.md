  to pursue in the region.

### From the Heartland to the Grand Chessboard:
- *Heartland* is the idea that the geopolitical world has three domains
  - Pivot Area (Russia, CA, Mongolia, Iran, Western China)
  - Inner Crescent (Germany, Austria, Turkey, India, China)
  - Outer Crescent (Britain, South Africa, Australia, the USA, Canada, and Japan)
  - Conflict lays between maritime and continental powers.
  - Development of transportation for land locked areas allowed them to threaten maritime powers.
    - British saw this as Russia threatening the "free world".

  - History and politics are characterized by the fight between continental and maritime
   civilizations.
  - Geographic determinism.
  - Represents a utilitarian theory.
  - Dugin proposes that policy divided into domestics recommendations and foreign recommendations.
  - Anti-Western sentiments.
